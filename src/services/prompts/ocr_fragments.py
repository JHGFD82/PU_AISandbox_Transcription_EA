"""The actual instruction text sent to the AI model for East-Asia OCR and transcription review.

Every constant in this file is a block of English instructions — the exact
wording the AI model reads before it transcribes an image or reviews a
transcription for errors. There is no logic here, only text; a few
constants contain ``{placeholder}`` spots (Python's ``str.format()``
syntax) that ``ocr.py`` and ``transcription_review.py`` fill in with
specifics like the target language.

To change how the model is instructed to handle kanbun, vertical script,
table preservation, or any other East-Asia-specific behavior, edit the
relevant constant directly — no other file needs to change. The constants
are grouped by what they're used for: OCR system/user prompts, kanbun
script guidance, the per-language script-guidance dictionary
(``OCR_SCRIPT_GUIDANCE``), and transcription-review prompts.

Used by:
  ``src/services/prompts/ocr.py`` (assembles ``OcrPromptSpec``'s prompts from these fragments)
  ``src/services/prompts/transcription_review.py`` (assembles ``TranscriptionReviewPromptSpec``'s prompts)
