# East Asia Transcription Plugin

Extends the [PU AI Sandbox](https://github.com/princeton-oit/PU_AISandbox) `transcribe` and `transcription_review` commands with East Asian language support: Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, with kanbun, vertical script, multi-pass OCR, table preservation, and parallel-worker options. English stays with the base plugin — see "Dispatch Model" below.

**Requires the base transcription plugin** (`plugins/transcription/`, which ships with the main repo) to be present. The base plugin owns the service layer and English OCR; this plugin adds EA language routing and EA-specific CLI flags.

---

## Known Issues

- **`transcription_review` currently fails for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.** It calls a method that doesn't exist on the request handler, so every `transcription_review zh|jp|kr ...` run raises an error before contacting the AI model. `transcribe` is unaffected. This is a known, tracked issue — check the git history or open issues before reporting it again.

---

## Installation

Clone this repo into the `plugins/transcription-ea/` directory inside the main PU_AISandbox repo:

```bash
# From the PU_AISandbox root:
git clone https://github.com/JHGFD82/PU_AISandbox_Transcription_EA plugins/transcription-ea
```

The plugin is discovered automatically at startup. No changes to the main repo are needed. Because plugin directories are loaded in alphabetical order, the base plugin (`transcription/`) always loads first and registers English before this plugin runs.

---

## Dispatch Model

When both plugins are installed, the plugin loader merges them into a single `DispatchPlugin` for each command. Each plugin declares a `handles` list of the full language names it owns; a request is routed to whichever plugin's `handles` list contains the requested language. This plugin's `handles` list is `["Chinese", "Japanese", "Korean"]` — it does **not** include English, so `en` is always routed to the base plugin, even when this plugin is installed.

| Language code | Handled by |
|---|---|
| `en` | Base plugin (English-only prompts; the flags below appear on the command line but the base plugin's `run()` doesn't act on them for `en`) |
| `zh` | This plugin |
| `jp` | This plugin |
| `kr` | This plugin |

The command-line flags below are added to `transcribe`/`transcription_review` regardless of which language is requested (both plugins contribute flags to the same shared parser), but kanbun/vertical/spread/table-preservation only take effect for `zh`, `jp`, and `kr`, since only this plugin's `run()` reads them.

When this plugin is **not** installed, `zh`/`jp`/`kr` aren't recognized at all — only the base plugin's `en` remains available.

## Configuration

### `settings.toml`

Controls default model parameters. Copy and edit to override:

```toml
[ocr]
temperature = 0.0          # Fully deterministic — reduces hallucination in transcription
top_p = 0.1                # Very low to prevent the model from inventing characters
max_tokens = 4000
frequency_penalty = 0.5    # Penalizes repeating the same tokens
presence_penalty = 0.3     # Encourages output diversity

[transcription_review]
temperature = 0.1          # Low temperature for precise, analytical error detection
top_p = 0.5                # Focused nucleus sampling
max_tokens = 4000          # JSON output; increase for very long transcriptions
```

The plugin searches upward from its own directory for the nearest `settings.toml` that contains `[ocr]` or `[transcription_review]`, so you can also edit the root-level `settings.toml` in the main repo.

## Running Tests

Tests live in `tests/` and use the main repo's virtual environment. Run from the plugin directory:

```bash
# Activate the main repo's venv first (if not already active):
source ../../.venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux

# Run all plugin tests:
cd plugins/transcription-ea
pytest

# Run a specific test file:
pytest tests/test_transcription_cli.py

# Run with verbose output or a specific keyword:
pytest -v
pytest -k "kanbun"
```

`conftest.py` adds the main repo root to `sys.path` automatically, so `src.*` imports resolve without extra setup.

## Language Codes

Pass a language code as the first positional argument:

| Code | Language |
|------|----------|
| `en` | English |
| `zh` | Chinese |
| `jp` | Japanese |
| `kr` | Korean |

---

## Usage

```bash
python main.py <professor> transcribe <language-code> [options]
python main.py <professor> transcription_review <language-code> [options]
```

### Basic examples

```bash
# Transcribe a single image:
python main.py heller transcribe jp -i scan.png

# Transcribe with vertical text layout:
python main.py heller transcribe jp -i page.jpg --vertical

# Transcribe a two-page spread:
python main.py heller transcribe zh -i spread.jpg --spread

# Transcribe kanbun with kundoku annotations:
python main.py heller transcribe jp -i kanbun.jpg --kanbun

# Transcribe only the main-line kanji (omit okurigana, furigana, kaeriten):
python main.py heller transcribe jp -i kanbun.jpg --kanbun-main

# Multi-pass OCR (initial transcription + 2 refinement passes):
python main.py heller transcribe jp -i page.jpg -P 3

# Transcribe a folder of images in parallel:
python main.py heller transcribe jp -i pages/ -w 4

# Dry run — print prompts without calling the API:
python main.py heller transcribe jp -i page.jpg --dry-run

# Review an existing transcription for OCR errors (returns JSON report):
python main.py heller transcription_review jp -i transcription.txt

# Review pasted text interactively:
python main.py heller transcription_review jp -c
```

## Flag Reference — `transcribe`

### Input / Output

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-i FILE/DIR`, `--input FILE/DIR` | Input image file path, or a folder of images to process in order. |
| `-o FILE`, `--output FILE` | Output file path. Extension determines format: `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`. |

### Text layout

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v`, `--vertical` | Text is predominantly vertical (top-to-bottom, right-to-left columns). |
